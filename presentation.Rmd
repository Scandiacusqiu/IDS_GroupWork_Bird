## Goal of the investigation:

### To predict certain characteristics of birds using their body measurements

class: inverse, center, middle

# Explaining Data Set

---

# Variables of Interest

.pull-left[
### Categorical Variables
 - Habitat: Where the birds live
 - Trophic.Level: Categorized by the bird's food source
 - Trophic.Niche: More detailed category of trophic level
]

.pull-right[
### Numerical Variables
 - Beak.Width
 - Beak.Depth
 - Centroid.Latitude: The geometric centre of the species range (restricted to breeding and resident range)
 - Hand-Wing.Index: 100*DK/Lw, where DK is Kipp’s distance and Lw is wing length (i.e., Kipp’s distance corrected for wing size)
]

# Starting our investigation:

---
# Construct a model
### Predicting Centroid.Latitude using "Range_Size", "Trophic_Level", "Habitat", and "Mass"
--

###Why?
We thought the place that the bird live defines the physical factor relate to the bird

# Select Data Needed
```{r Latitude ~ .}
# Choose needed data
data_lat1 <- data %>% 
  select(Beak.Length_Culmen, 
         Beak.Length_Nares, 
         Beak.Depth, 
         Range.Size, 
         Habitat, 
         Mass, 
         Centroid.Latitude)

# Using xaringan

---

# xaringan

- The presentation is created using the `xaringan` package

- Use `---` to separate slides and `--` for incremental builds

--

- Like this

---

# Layouts

You can use plain text

- or bullet points

.pull-left[
or text in two columns $^*$
]
.pull-right[
- like
- this
]

.footnote[
[*] And add footnotes
]

---

# Code

```{r boring-regression}
# a boring regression
model <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
tidy(model)
glance(model)
```

---

# Plots

```{r recode-species, echo = FALSE}
# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.
iris_modified <- iris %>%
  mutate(Species = fct_other(Species, keep = "setosa"))
```

```{r plot-iris, echo = FALSE}
# Code hidden with echo = FALSE
# Uses modified iris dataset from previous chunk
# Play around with height and width until you're happy with the look
ggplot(data = iris_modified, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal() # theme options: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html
```

---

## Plot and text

.pull-left[
- Some text
- goes here
]
.pull-right[
```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}
# see how I changed out.width and fig.width from defaults
# to make the figure bigger
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = species, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()
```
]

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r iris-table, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```

---

# Images

```{r castle, echo = FALSE, out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Image credit: Photo by Jörg Angeli on Unsplash."}
include_graphics("img/edinburgh-castle.jpg")
```

Or you can also include a full page image. See next slide.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcome to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
